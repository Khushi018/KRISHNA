'Srimad Bhagavad Gita' is just not a holy book, it has also gained a prominent place in literature of the world. It contains divine words emanating from the lips of Lord Krishna. The great epic is an eloquent proof of the observation. As a scripture, this book embodies the supreme spiritual mystery and secrets. Its style is so simple and elegant that with a little study one can easily follow the structure of its words, yet the thoughts behind those words are so deep and abstruse that even for life time, constant study of this Book may not show an end of it.

'The Bhagavad Gita' is an unfathomable ocean of wisdom. It is a bottomless sea containing endless strate of meanings. Just as a driver deep in the sea lays his hands on precious gems, similarly diving deeper and deeper into the secrets of this Book, the seeker goes on discovering more and more piles of extraordinary gems of thoughts and ideas.

'The Bhagavad Gita' is a part of Mahatbharata, but even then it has its own identity, which has made it more prominent than the Mahabharata. It may look to be just a narration of the happenings of the war between Kauravas and Pandavas, but it is the philosophy of life, expressed from the lips of Lord Krishna, addressed to the warrior Arjuna, defining following ideas : 

(i) Facing your enemies in a war is an asupicious and especial duty;

(ii) The Lord alone is to be worshipped, and that only by doings one's own duties. Any other worship or duty should be abandoned.

(iii) Devotion to the Lord is the mean to which all the rest is subservient;

(iv) The Lord is far different from the whole world and every thing is under His comtrol. He is the Supreme being, perfect in every excellence.

(v) The human being is obliged to perform his duties without hoping for the fruits which he may get out of his performace.
